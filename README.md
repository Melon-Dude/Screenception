**Screenify your work**

This addon streamlines the creation of accurate PBR screen materials, done all in a few clicks. No longer will you have to struggle with the confusing math nodes, leave it to Screenception's screenify function. Even though this addon is designed to be one-click, that does not mean that you cannot customize the material output either!

**How do I use it?**

Simply download the Screenception.zip file, and install that file how you would any other addon file! Once the addon is installed, you can access it through the 3D viewport side panel, which is opened by pressing the 'N' key. On that menu, there should be a tab called Screenception! Screen away!

**Where can it go next?**

There are many features I wanted to add, but still need to learn how to. The next major planned feature is the ability to choose between types of screens, and remnants of that feature can still be found in the code.
